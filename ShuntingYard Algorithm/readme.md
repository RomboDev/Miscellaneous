A structured and modular approach to the Shunting Yard Algorithm written in C++.

Variable 'x' can be used to evaluate a shader input for example and from there build some math expressions.

Remarkably, this doesn't work : 3+(-2)
meaning.. I don't plan to fix it :)

Compile it with  : g++ -o mathparser ShuntingYardAlgorithm.cpp -lm
Then run it with : ./mathparser
